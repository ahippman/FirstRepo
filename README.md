# FirstRepo
This is only a test repo. It will be public. Let's see how it goes!

This amazing sentence that I am writing right now you will be reading as you read this... is written in RStudio! How cool is that?!

This is another line where I will check if the push workd without me having to fill in the info

And one more try

OK now i figured it out! I had forgotten to first commit THEN push. SO to recap:

1) Save
2) Commit
3) Push

I wonder what happens if I commit, then change and save and Then commit again and push only in the end.... hhhhmmmmm

Alright now we try it! -> safe and commit
